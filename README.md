# Reddit_scraping_API

Reddit craping API using Python and PRAW.

While looking through Reddit for interesting content on AI I decided to create API that will do it for me. I used PRAW - Python Reddit API Wrapper, so if you want to run the scripts from this repository you need to install PRAW. You also need to have account on reddit and generate your client id and client secret, to enter it to main_unauthorised.py script.
